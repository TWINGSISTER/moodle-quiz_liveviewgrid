# moodle-quiz_liveviewgrid
Dynamic quiz spreadsheet. <br />
This version v1.0 (2018052400) is compatible for Moodle 3.2-3.5.<br />
This quiz report module allows teachers to see, in real time, the responses from students as they are completing questions in a quiz. As students change their answers or submit more answers, the spreadsheet is refreshed. If desired, the grades that each response would be given can be shown as the background color in the cells of the spreadsheet, but this action is unrelated to the grading of the quiz.<br />
To install this module, place the liveviewgrid directory as a sub-directory in the <your moodle site>/mod/quiz/report/ directory, creating the <your moodle site>/mod/quiz/report/liveviewgrid/ directory.
After installing this quiz report module, teachers can click on the "Live Report" option in the "Report" drop-down menu to access this spreadsheet.
